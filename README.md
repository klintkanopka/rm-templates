# rm-templates

- **Stalogy** - template based on the Stalogy Editor's Notebook. Font used is Adobe Source Code Pro Bold. Note that the background color is transparent.
- **5E Character Sheets** - I take no credit for these. They are from Reddit user u/asifbymagnets. 
- **install.sh** - A quick script to copy all the `.png` and `.svg` files in this repo, as well as an updated `templates.json` over `scp`. Probably not useful for you, but useful for me to be able to transfer between machines.
